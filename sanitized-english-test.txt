this is an appeal to the majority of austrians who have not voted for haider who have voted for the clearly democratic options committed to europe and i must point out that mr sch ssel may have been minister for finance but chancellor vranitzky also contributed to austria' s integration process
we should not be so politically partisan
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture
we all took part in it not just one group
therefore madam president i believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the austrians to reconsider and reflect because this type of menace which we have suffered before in europe may not only harm austria but it may also spread and i say this bearing history in mind
therefore apart from the apology which mr sch ssel has made offering us all kinds of guarantees as did chamberlain and daladier in 1938 in munich i would like to know whether the ppe intends to implement measures in relation to the austrian people' s party if it goes ahead with this mad project
thirdly if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance i can assure you that we can forget the european union' s main objective - enlargement - because if we were czechs slovenes or hungarians what would we say faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence
we support the council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option
applause from the pse group
madam president my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment
this is the first time in the history of the modern european project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right
that is deeply disturbing
the fp contends that if one reads their literature and their programme there is much in it that one could share
that may be but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we liberal democrats had with the austrian fp in our liberal international family
as early as 1986 we had cause to believe that mr j rg haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism
in november of 1991 after a long internal debate in liberal international and many visits to vienna to discuss issues we suspended the fp from membership and in july 1993 we expelled them
we expelled them then and we continue to reject what mr haider stands for now
let me share what we learned in that long experience
there were many in our ranks who said read the text there were many more in our ranks who said read the subtext look at the context
words in politics can be incendiary can be inflammatory or can be conciliatory
we found that mr j rg haider as a wordsmith has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia
he is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability
that is why this debate is important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism something profound is happening in europe today
applause
i hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the austrian people
we respect the rights of the austrian people to their own democratic process
we defend the rights and constitutional prerogatives of the austrian people but we here in the european parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental values as set out in article 6 of the treaty - the values of freedom democracy and respect for human rights
every right-thinking person in this house believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour class or creed
we must promote and defend those rights all the while saying to the people of austria our quarrel is not with you
i wish to say with regard to the initiative of the portuguese presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it
it may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept mr president-in-office that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it
i share with president prodi a preference for the community method and we must look at article 6 and article 7 of the treaty
article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values
we must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance
then we can work together by the community method to root out this cancer within our midst
i want to say madame president some words to mr sch ssel
mr sch ssel is a man with an honourable record in european politics
he now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger
mr sch ssel - you are assuming a very serious personal national and european responsibility
that responsibility which you mr sch ssel now take on is to respect the letter and the spirit of the european treaties
finally madame president this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance
on this continent of all places with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost we have to insist that today' s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a state
it is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this union that we will not as europeans countenance turning the clock back
loud applause
madam president the events taking place today in austria are extremely serious
for the first time the european union is facing the possibility of having representatives in the council of ministers and here among us of a party which obviously holds views and puts forward legislation contrary to the values of the european union
i shall make three comments on this matter to illustrate the gravity of the problem
i believe personally that this is the first stage if it does actually take place in the inclusion of extremists in governments becoming quite commonplace
i also believe it gives an extremely negative political message to the vulnerable democracies which are candidates for membership of the european union and which are going to join us
i feel finally that this is a case of political decline of the european union as such and it therefore also sends a negative message outside the union when we are speaking in the name of democracy and human rights
some people have said that we were interfering in problems internal to austria
some people have said that we were stigmatising the austrian people and that we were effectively putting words into the mouth of a future government
is it really putting words into someone' s mouth if we pay attention to what a political leader has been saying for many years when it shows an obvious tendency to go against everything that we want
we are not putting words into someone' s mouth or stigmatising the austrian people if we send a friendly message saying friends beware of what may soon happen in your country and what may contaminate the whole of europe not a radical change - i think mr haider is too intelligent for that - but a gradual erosion of democratic rights a slow erosion by cultural contagion and that is extremely dangerous
applause
let me thank you madam president for your contribution on behalf of parliament
it was both pertinent and politically intelligent
applause
i should also like to thank the presidency of the council for the firm pertinent and moderate statement it has made
applause
finally i should like to address the party which whether we like it or not is the target of our comments the ppe de
i would like to address mr poettering and also indirectly mr martens a compatriot and former colleague
i have heard mr poettering that you have been following events in austria
i would rather have had you anticipate them and particularly condemn on behalf of your party the very principle of an alliance with people who practice verbal violence who stigmatise the weak who hold xenophobic views and who refuse to condemn the nazi regime
applause
mr poettering i do not doubt your concern for democracy but i believe that you are making a serious political mistake
and to paraphrase one of my renowned fellow belgians one of the founders of europe paul-henri spaak i shall say that it is not yet too late for you but now is the time to change your mind
madam president in my group' s opinion the european union today faces a political and ethical challenge which is without precedent since the creation of the union
the european union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a member state government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the union
however with haider and his men we would see the extreme right openly racist anti-semitic and xenophobic promoted to the rank of co-ruler of our community
going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testifying albeit unwillingly to the respectability of a political force which is not respectable
it would mean making the unacceptable commonplace on the scale of europe as a whole it would mean making nonsense of the european institutions' solemn proclamations on the fundamental values which unite us and which we demand rightly so of applicants for membership
this is why we support the spirit of the statement made by the presidency and the 14 member states as well as that of the president of the european parliament insofar as unlike the lacklustre and ambiguous statement made by the commission it aims to make people get the measure of the danger and to provoke a response
of course there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of austria
any action which can be taken must in our opinion serve the twofold function of proscribing haider without however isolating austrian society
democrats in this country now need our support more than ever
the great joining of forces in protest in vienna on 12 november last year must now undergo developments suited to the new situation
we must have dialogue with them and join forces with them stand at their side in order to offer the people of austria some alternative prospects
finally we must ask ourselves how did we come to be in this position
certainly in the first instance as far as austrian political leaders are concerned it is a matter of answering this existential question for the future of democracy starting with those who have just taken the inordinate risk of giving the extreme right a boost
but beyond that no one including the european union can in our opinion be exempted from asking themselves what grounds there are for permitting an unscrupulous demagogue to exploit the frustrations and fears generated by policies in which too many sectors of the population are disregarded
this debate is now before us but each and every one of us male and female is going to assume their responsibilities without delay
applause
madam president today we have an appointment with hypocrisy
here we have a council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a state in the event of a serious and persistent breach
in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria
there are risks as we are all aware but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach
if we were to apply the criteria of articles 6 and 7 or the copenhagen criteria to the european union then most certainly this european union could not become a member although the countries of eastern europe are required to meet them
and if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches then perhaps we could mention some member states such as italy and france first and third respectively in the list of countries condemned by the council of europe and the strasbourg court
we could mention my belgian friends belgium and the dutroux case the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped tortured raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country where inquiries are bogged down making no headway
we could if one third of the members of parliament so requested require that the council and the commission look into the matter
we could ask ourselves why the austrians are rejecting 10 years 13 years of party politics which has made one country - austria - corrupt and rotten just as it is now corrupting countries such as italy belgium and other european union member states
we might well wonder why 76 of belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 of french citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice and 53 of italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in italian justice
the president cut the speaker off
madame president my group the edd and especially my party are very concerned by this debate
we cannot and we do not support in any way the sentiments and politics of herr haider and we deplore his references to the third reich
we also however deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country especially one which is part of the european union
my party at home are certainly not racists but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well
are you going to interfere with great britain' s parliament if we are elected
madame president the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament
i believe they gave him 28 of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government
your parliament may i suggest madame president should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country
then and only then might you consider if human rights are affected
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then madame president and only then may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union
madam president as a representative of the freedom party i respect the concerns some of my fellow meps have with regard to the democratic developments in austria
my reaction may come as a surprise when i say that i personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards austria in matters of respect for human rights having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past and the stability of democracy
austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it rightly or wrongly
the refusal of our government down through the years to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the second world war together with their refusal to properly compensate the jewish victims and those forced into hard labour have done a great deal to bolster this negative image
this fp has now entered into a coalition with the vp due to the outcome of elections held on 3 october 1999 when the previous government was voted out of office
this is the citizen of a state' s prerogative for it is the founding principle of a democracy
when the talks between the sp and vp broke down the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fp for their support
we were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here
when we suddenly refused this offer an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day
the fp party is established in austria' s political landscape
the head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments
what many austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind and why the campaign did not begin until the freedom party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the sp
there is prejudice at work here which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of european history to a political spectacle
i am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda as for example the italian mep bertinotti did yesterday on italian tv when he accused mr haider of denying the holocaust
shame on you mr bertinotti
you might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda
denouncing a democratically elected politician as a nazi does not make you an anti-fascist
on the contrary you are deriding the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did
your behaviour stems from your own prejudices you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose
the attacks against austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a member state are an insult to the austrian people
that is why we are indebted to the commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest
the new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy the rights of the opposition commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour
the president cut the speaker off
madam president to begin with i would like to make one thing abundantly clear austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion
austria is a stable democracy one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary
austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there
there is nothing unusual about what is happening in austria there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition
the austrian people' s party which i represent here in this parliament used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the eu and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the european union and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria
our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present
our country was not just the first victim of the hitler dictatorship many people were perpetrators too although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt
the vp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union
my country' s place is not outside the european union but in it
with all the rights and commitments that this entails
any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media
a declared belief in human rights democracy and the rule of law in an honest reappraisal of austria' s role in the past in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century the holocaust will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the vp and fp
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values
applause
madam president mr president-in-office of the council representatives of the commission it is a black day for austria and for europe
not even mr sichrovsky' s web of lies or mrs stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that
for the day has dawned two irresponsible politicians consumed with a lust for power are selling austria' s image political role and to some extent even its economic interests down the river
applause heckling
they are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government
they are just as prepared to take on board the fact that austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens
i believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against haider and his brand of politics and especially my colleagues in the social democratic delegation in this chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives are grave and also inappropriate
however my criticism - and i freely admit this - my rage is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so messrs sch ssel and haider and their parties
and that includes their representatives in this parliament
mr poettering it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as i am albeit for different reasons for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions
you are having to defend a certain mr sch ssel you are having to consort with sch ssel as he is today and who as i understand it was recently told not to come to the representatives of the christian democratic party' s summit meeting
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play i e that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system
however in my view he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this into our political system and into the europe of today than any other extreme right-wing movement
anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from national socialism has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate
applause
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured
that is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the vp - is sustained rather than kept in check
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government
however by the same token there is another austria the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the fp having any involvement in government and who will continue to demonstrate against this government
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria
applause
the more powerful this europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the europe of today the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy or even against a relapse into barbarism
please support the austrian people against this government
applause
madam president this is an historic moment as it is now at last quite clear to us all that the european union has gradually developed into a community of values
we see this now that the government of one member state is being joined by a party which as is known does not respect all these values
i would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the council was justified as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the european union meaning this is also a matter for the council and not merely an internal affair of austria' s
as members of parliament we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever
it is more important than ever that respect for and non-violation of human values and the rights of minorities including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the european union form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the eu and for this reason the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration
as important is the fact that austria' s forces of democracy should be given support as none of us wishes to isolate the country
we know that most austrians respect these values
they have also shown how they feel not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy
i also appeal to the austrian president that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces
madam president i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group francis wurtz reminded us of just now
i welcome the statements by the presidency of the council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an austrian government that includes j rg haider' s party
the fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because as you know we essentially disagree with the policies made by europe with its economic and social policies its democratic deficit and the member states' involvement in the terrible war in the balkans
our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational neo-nazi element in europe is extraordinary
this danger does not concern austria it concerns europe
we are talking about us not austria
we know the social causes which contribute along with unemployment and instability to fuelling tendencies towards this we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in europe
not only the alpine region but all our countries are involved the conditions are being created whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation
europe is showing that it has not forgotten auschwitz europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past
now though it should follow through with its actions and the first to follow through should be the commission which however has been obscure and weak on this making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent
this is the change we must impose on the commission' s action
madam president despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples which opposes fascism nazism or communism both new and old and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the austrian people we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by parliament
in the manifesto of the austrian democratic freedom party there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights fundamental freedoms or the rule of law enshrined in article 6 of the treaties
i would however like to draw your attention to the fact that the president-in-office who has been so critical of austria has recently consigned the inhabitants of macao to the sovereign rule of the people' s democratic republic of china
perhaps in order to strengthen the union' s democracy it would now be appropriate to isolate austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the austrian citizens while bringing turkey and its grey wolves into europe
madam president we are debating an extremely serious issue
we are debating nothing less than the presence in a member state' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the union enshrined in its founding treaties
a simple reading of chapter 4 article 1 of the austrian freedom party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder
the view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others as is written here revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind which some historians have described as the century of horrors horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind mr haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again to our amazement
of course austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a member state
however that is not the problem
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party
our answer to this crucial question is no
leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests the spanish delegation of the people' s group of this parliament in full agreement with the spanish people' s party and the spanish government clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 january by the portuguese presidency of the council we agree with its substance its tone and its scope
applause
konrad adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided
therefore madam president the union and the assembly must send an unequivocal message rejecting of the tiger of intolerance xenophobia and totalitarianism so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications renunciations and opportunism which mark europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price
loud applause
madam president the european union was built upon the idea 'never again' meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia concentration camps anti-semitism heightened nationalism or war
the one and only significance of the european union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de gr ce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of europe and which is still highly topical today
it is not true to say that when a government forms an alliance with neo-fascists somewhere in europe this is merely a question of national sovereignty
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances
it is a community that is destined to exist in which when the main thing is under threat when values are under threat all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again
let us learn the lessons of the past
in the thirties when adolf hitler was democratically elected although with a minority many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and mr poettering in france a number of men and women on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too thought 'better hitler in france than the front populaire '
they put their own petty squabbles first and the rest is history
we must make a rapid strong and united response
i would have liked to hear your discussion with the austrian president mr poettering we are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance
so our response must be rapid and strong
of course the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable i was almost going to say 'irreparable'
history has taught us that fascists start to blow hot and cold using heated words first in populist xenophobic speeches and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually poisoning them until the day they start to take action
and when that day comes it is too late
so our treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late but we are not at that point today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point
we must therefore find a political solution
i support the council proposals in this while deploring a certain lack of strength a certain spinelessness on the part of the commission which will however have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis with determination over time since fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end
our response must be rapid
if today we do not staunchly support the council then history will judge us saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the munich agreement
madam president i am pleased about the fact that in austria the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes in my eyes a huge victory for democracy
let there be no doubt about it we decline with thanks a europe which develops into a kind of big brother and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one member state or another in a stalinist way and using stalinist methods
european democracy and austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a belgian government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party which was condemned by the court to the post of european commissioner
today we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech
madam president this debate was opened by mr da costa who merely confirms that the eu presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member states
this debate and the background to it reinforced the point that the council the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists
my delegation of 37 conservative and unionist members from the united kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy programme and tone of austria' s freedom party
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history in particular world war ii but also its policies on enlargement on immigration on race and its attitude to the european union itself
we were also outraged however at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny the terror and the excesses of the former ussr
even today surely it is high time for the party of european socialists to break their fraternal links with china' s communist party
not a word was said by these same eu governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in french or italian governments or in german state governments or even the british government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in northern ireland today
this madam president is the hypocrisy of the left
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards especially of the british government and the other largely socialist heads of eu governments and include that of the united states
we should recognise however that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results
this requires action to address the underlying causes including an examination of the electoral process itself
that should be our task not political posturing
madam president representative of the council commissioner a week ago the big international holocaust conference ended in stockholm
its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite at this time into the institutions of the eu a xenophobic party which flirts with nazi ideas
secondly i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations
we demand of the candidate states and of the countries with which the eu cooperates under the lom agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned
that is why we are reacting against this carry-on in austria
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values something which we take seriously something has happened
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine
madam president as everyone has said this is a very important day it is the day of the first debate of european political life
and this is not pure chance
i feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of europe our institutions with austria or mr haider' s party
it is the meeting of europe with itself with its raison d' tre with the reasons why we are here in this chamber
this chamber was not made for goods it was not made for money
this chamber and the european institutions were build to uphold values morality and a certain spirit
in the twentieth century we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk and morality values and the spirit which i mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name nationalist glorification populism and the concept of racial superiority
the fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of mr haider' s party the fp to find nationalist glorification populism and racial superiority in every chapter
reading only one sentence which my friend mr vidal-quadras has previously mentioned the nation is defined by its location culture and race locally ethnically and culturally
well we cannot accept such statements
if europe has any meaning and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if christian democracy has any meaning if the history of christian democracy has any meaning then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation
this is the reason why i feel that the european parliament which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the council or the commission must pay tribute to those people in the various states and european institutions who had the courage to say no and it must say madam president that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit and in clear terms declare without prevarication its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in austria recalling the statement made on the day of the munich agreement by a great french christian democrat who said that if you are going to have to say no then the best time to do so is right at the beginning
applause
madam president we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as fortunately are a great many other members too
the coalition which is being created in one of the member states is clearly an austrian affair but undoubtedly has a european dimension too because what is it that unites us in europe
surely it is the values and principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights more than anything
the austrian freedom party leader mr haider has repeatedly repudiated these values
he also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness
he is a dangerous man
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders
values should take precedence over power
we deplore therefore what is happening in austria
in fact we were shaken by it
we are extremely disappointed
as a last resort we would ask the vp to look into alternatives
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right
if despite this the coalition goes ahead we would urge the vp party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie european integration are observed in political programmes both in word and deed
madam president austria awaits a heavy responsibility
madam president it is clear that we in this parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting mr haider and his politics but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the council presidency last weekend are having in austria itself
have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here
have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in austria in the course of the next few days
from all accounts this would only serve to strengthen haider
who would want this to happen
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics
europe is a community of law
democracy respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold
one of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them and that is why we must respect the fact that the austrians by virtue of their political culture voted as they did
it is for reasons of constitutionality that the president-in-office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did and in a manner that goes against the treaty
it would be politically astute not to isolate the vp but to support it as an undeniably democratic constitutional and well-known european party so as to be equally certain that austria will continue to be a member of this european community and that is why we must give the vp our support in this difficult situation and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take
applause
madam president they say where i come from 'it' s three times for a welshman' and three times as i think you will discover in the course of that debate i signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent and on several occasions a moving debate
first of all could i express my thanks on behalf of president prodi and my colleagues in the commission for the support and understanding offered by several members of the house to the position taken by the commission in the statement that we made yesterday
i must respond also to the fact of course that there were references during the debate - and i use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity the complacency and the fragility of the commission' s opinion
i am duty- bound to say to this house there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered or indeed the action taken by the commission on this issue
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement as did the president this afternoon to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen member states in their statement on monday
secondly we said in very specific terms that we will work closely with all member states in examining the situation as it develops in austria
thirdly we expressed in very explicit terms that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of article 6 of the treaty and that we will take our part under article 7 of the treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld
there is no complacency no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all
and when i say that the commission took that view i include my dear colleague franz fischler who is from austria and who once again demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a member of the european commission under oath in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning
anyone therefore who invites franz fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is austrian should examine their own motives in the context of a debate which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague franz fischler
could i also say madam president that the understanding of the presidency the portuguese presidency for our position was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by mr da costa when he said and i quote him that 'portugal and the other member states want to ensure that the working of the community machine is not affected by the current situation'
that surely is in everyone' s interests
in order to ensure that the treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the community machine we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday
we will continue to do that madam president without fear or favour
that is our duty
it is also a matter of conviction
my final point is this we understand the context of this essential debate
there are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with herr haider' s offensive statements the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies sometimes on successive days
we understand that and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism
and when we recall that like many others on all sides of this house my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused
however the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning
that is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law
without fragility without complacency without ambiguity but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as mr cox said in the debate 'necessarily with acute vigilance'
i wonder since mr da costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the chamber whether mr kinnock could confirm that the commission supports the view explicitly stated by mr da costa today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government
does the commission support the council
madam president when the commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen member states and shares the concern that gave rise to that view i think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning as soon as the commission could discuss the issue it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the member states
thank you commissioner kinnock
i think that we have just had a great political debate equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it
thank you ladies and gentlemen
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed
the vote will take place at 11 a m tomorrow
recourse to the precautionary principle
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle

i want to start by saying that i am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle and it has been written together with david byrne and erkki liikanen
the precautionary principle is not a new concept
it has been used by the community for some time now in a range of policy areas environmental human animal and plant health and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the ec treaty since maastricht
it also appears in a range of international texts for example the rio declaration and most recently the bio-safety protocol
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear
it involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action
however the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years
events such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary
in view of this growing interest the commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle
the basic aim of the communication is twofold
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the commission applies and intends to apply the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles
we also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism
the commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental human animal and plant health
of course this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear
as such while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science as some have alleged it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society
it is therefore political by nature
however the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut
they must be non-discriminatory in their application that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken
for example if one product has been approved similar products should also be approved
measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action that is the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment that is the burden of proof
all these elements have to apply cumulatively
it is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle
for example a research programme public information campaigns recommendations and so on
applying the precautionary principle does not therefore automatically imply a ban
this communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue however it is the first time that the commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use
by setting out in some detail how the commission applies and intends to apply the precautionary principle we hope to be able to clarify the situation at community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at european and international level
mr president commissioner thank you very much for your statement
i have three short questions the first being as follows
we have been awaiting a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speaks with one voice
does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the commissioners for industry foreign trade competition and the internal market
i am sure that your answer to this will be yes but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be
my next question mrs wallstr m is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors for example
lastly will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation
in other words will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached

thank you very much dagmar roth-behrendt for these questions
of course this is shared by the whole commission
this is a common communication which was written by the three of us david byrne erkki liikanen and myself but it has been passed unanimously in the commission today
it received strong support from the rest of the commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the commission
so we have really worked through this document and i am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document
yes i would say we already use this way of working with different difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example
and i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle
we have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft pvc toys and of course we apply it in several different environmental areas
it has been mainly used in the environmental field but of course also when it comes to human health
so we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it
mr president commissioner regarding the relationship between science on the one hand and applying the precautionary principle on the other the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence
needless to say this accords science a great deal of power
we might ask ourselves what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for
the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists
i would like to ask what is then the definition of a recognised minority
how would you describe this
what establishes a recognised minority
if a political decision is involved i would also like to ask who takes this political decision
the commission
the council
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this
what is the role of the scientific committees
what also will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up
finally will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent public way
these are my three questions

yes mr president that is true
there were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear but i will try to answer some questions
who will take the decision who are the decision-makers
well that depends on who the legislators are
this is part of risk management
they have to look at for example the concerns of people in relation to a special issue and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case
however it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete
that is of course where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science
it is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done but there is no question of changing the scientific base
we use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision and that should also be done in the future
you have to see this as a tool for risk management
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger for example or if you want to protect the environment and you have to look at the science that is available
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science
then you decide to take a measure or not to take action or not
so there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today
mr president i have a question concerning an actual concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle
it is about brominated flame retardants
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment
there are many people who maintain that they entail major risks while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are
recently both sweden and denmark urged the commission in the council of ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants
i am wondering therefore if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative

sv mr president thank you very much mr sj stedt for this question
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do
allow me to remind you however that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken
it ought not therefore to be immediately interpreted as a ban
where brominated flame retardants are concerned there may eventually be a ban but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken
this issue is extremely topical
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do

sv mr president i am pleased to be able to tell you that in montreal we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety
we succeeded there in agreeing at an international forum as to the definition of the precautionary principle
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted
it is moreover also accepted as an important and effective tool
mr president i have two questions i shall try to be very brief indeed
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle
as i have understood it there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out including a cost-benefit analysis
in that case i am rather concerned because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced instead the precautionary principle should come first
my second question concerns the burden of proof
i remember margot wallstr m being introduced as commissioner in the committee
at that time she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof in other words a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now

sv thank you mrs sch rling
these are two important questions and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them
no one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis
instead the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals
when on the other hand the decision has been made to take a certain measure the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness
it is not therefore the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this
there however we are concerned with that particular area whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern
therefore the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context instead it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this
it is however perfectly correct that when it comes for example to chemicals we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof
mr president i believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible
i will give an example a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind it is therefore a teratogenic substance
very well it is a fungicide it kills off mould
this teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests
now in my opinion given that this is such a serious risk to health the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market which new zealand has done for example
so i want to put this question to you when human health is at stake or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high there are no benefits that can compensate for this
in short commissioner i would therefore like to know whether in this case the precautionary principle as you understand it would in any case require the product to be taken off the market until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary

sv mr president no one wants more than i do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment
obviously i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case
the truth of course is that a great many member states and no doubt other nations too have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle even if it has not always been called that
naturally it is not in the first place a question of cost there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure
i think however it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between
in those circumstances consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result
i cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it namely when i was on a visit to africa
at a hospice for aids patients i met two irish catholic nuns who were caring for dying aids patients
they were the first to say that each day they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there we must be very careful about how we use resources
i believe we can learn something from this
we must of course always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help
as is also explained in the present communication it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis
consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health
mr president it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions
commissioner i would like to come back again to my first question when i asked about the other commissioners for it may have sounded as though i was in jest
indeed you responded in kind as i knew you would do
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill asked that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union
i have good reason for asking this
as you rightly said the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where as yet there is no scientific evidence
how can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time for example by our partners in the usa on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes
how can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy will not as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors keep pulling the carpet from underneath you
that is exactly what it is all about otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here commissioner
mr president i think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons
i am certain that we are going to have more conflicts for example with the united states we should not be so na ve as to think otherwise
ever since we signed this protocol in montreal we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment health and trade
